abstract = {We construct a data-driven model for solar irradiation based on satellite observations. The model yields probabilistic estimates of the irradiation field every thirty minutes starting from two consecutive satellite measurements. The probabilistic nature of the model captures prediction uncertainties and can therefore be used by solar energy producers to quantify the operation risks. The model is simple to implement and can make predictions in realtime with minimal computational resources. To deal with the high-dimensionality of the satellite data, we construct a reduced representation using factor analysis. Then, we model the dynamics of the reduced representation as a discrete (30-min interval) dynamical system. In order to convey information about the movement of the irradiation field, the dynamical system has a two-step delay. The dynamics are represented in a nonlinear, nonparametric way by a recursive Gaussian process. The predictions of the model are compared with observed satellite data as well as with a similar model that uses only ground observations at the prediction site. We conclude that using satellite data in an area including the prediction site significantly improves the prediction compared with models using only ground observation site data.},

abstract = {A k-nearest neighbor (kNN) ensemble model has been developed to generate Probability Density Function (PDF) forecasts for intra-hour Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI). This probabilistic forecasting model, which uses diffuse irradiance measurements and cloud cover information as exogenous feature inputs, adaptively provides arbitrary PDF forecasts for different weather conditions. The proposed models have been quantitatively evaluated using data from different locations characterized by different climates (continental, coastal, and island). The performance of the forecasts is quantified using metrics such as Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP), Prediction Interval Normalized Averaged Width (PINAW), Brier Skill Score (BSS), and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and other standard error metrics. A persistence ensemble probabilistic forecasting model and a Gaussian probabilistic forecasting model are employed to benchmark the performance of the proposed kNN ensemble model. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperform both reference models in terms of all evaluation metrics for all locations when the forecast horizon is greater than 5-min. In addition, the proposed model shows superior performance in predicting DNI ramps.},

We train and validate the forecasting methodology with measured irradiance and sky imaging data collected for a six-month period, and apply it operationally to forecast both global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance at two separate locations characterized by different micro-climates (coastal and continental) in California. The performance of the operational forecasts is assessed in terms of common statistical metrics, and also in terms of three proposed ramp metrics, used to assess the quality of ramp predictions. Results show that the forecasting platform proposed in this work outperforms the reference persistence model for both locations.},

abstract = {A smart, real-time reforecast method is applied to the intra-hour prediction of power generated by a 48 MWe photovoltaic (PV) plant. This reforecasting method is developed based on artificial neural network (ANN) optimization schemes and is employed to improve the performance of three baseline prediction models: (1) a physical deterministic model based on cloud tracking techniques; (2) an auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) model; and (3) a k-th Nearest Neighbor (kNN) model. Using the measured power data from the PV plant, the performance of all forecasts is assessed in terms of common error statistics (mean bias, mean absolute error and root mean square error) and forecast skill over the reference persistence model. With the reforecasting method, the forecast skills of the three baseline models are significantly increased for time horizons of 5, 10, and 15min. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the optimized reforecasting method in reducing learnable errors produced by a diverse set of forecast methodologies.},

This article aims at providing a Model Output Statistics (MOS) method of improving solar irradiance forecasts from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The WRF model was used to produce one year of day ahead solar irradiance forecasts covering Reunion Island with an horizontal resolution of 3km. These forecasts are refined with a Kalman filter using hourly high quality ground measurements. Determination of the relevant data inputs for the Kalman filter method is realized with a bias error analysis. The solar zenith angle and the clear sky index, among others, are used for this analysis. Accuracy of the method is evaluated with a comprehensive testing procedure using different error metrics. The Kalman filtering appears to be a viable method in order to improve the solar irradiance forecasting.},

abstract = {Small grid-connected photovoltaic systems up to 5kWp are often not monitored because advanced surveillance systems are not economical. Hence, some system failures which lead to partial energy losses stay unnoticed for a long time. Even a failure that results in a larger energy deficit can be difficult to detect by PV laymen due to the fluctuating energy yields. Within the EU project PVSAT-2, a fully automated performance check has been developed to assure maximum energy yields and to optimize system maintenance for small grid-connected PV systems. The aim is the early detection of system malfunctions and changing operating conditions to prevent energy and subsequent financial losses for the operator. The developed procedure is based on satellite-derived solar irradiance information that replaces on-site measurements. In conjunction with a simulation model the expected energy yield of a PV system is calculated. In case of the occurrence of a defined difference between the simulated and actual energy yield, an automated failure detection routine searches for the most probable failure sources and notifies the operator. This paper describes the individual components of the developed procedure—the satellite-derived irradiance, the used PV simulation model, and the principles of the automated failure detection routine. Moreover, it presents results of an 8-months test phase with 100PV systems in three European countries.},

abstract = {The rapidly growing installed base of distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is causing increased interest in forecasting their power output. A key step towards this is accurately estimating the output from a PV system based on the known output from a nearby PV system. However, each PV system is unique with its own hardware configuration, orientation, shading, etc. Thus, the process of using the power output from one system to estimate the power output of another nearby system is not necessarily straightforward. In order to address these challenges, a modified clear-sky index for photovoltaics is proposed. This index is the ratio of the instantaneous PV power output to the instantaneous theoretical clear-sky power output derived from a clear-sky radiation model and PV system simulation routine. This definition performs better than previous clear-sky indices when both PV systems' characteristics are known and the two PV systems have similar orientations. Through this index, the performance of a nearby PV system can be predicted quite accurately. This is demonstrated through the analysis of power output data from five residential PV systems in Canberra, Australia. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Herein, the methodology developed and tested in this study is based on multispectral tests and binary cross correlations followed by coherence and quality control tests over resulting motion vectors. Monthly synthetic surface albedo image and a method to reject erroneous correlation vectors were developed. Cloud classification in terms of opacity and height of cloud top is also performed.

This adds to social costs and also requires electricity system operators to reoptimize key decisions with large-scale renewables. We develop a method to quantify the economic value of large-scale renewable energy. We estimate the model for southeastern Arizona. Not accounting for offset CO2, we find social costs of 138.4/MWh for 20{\%} solar generation, of which unforecastable intermittency accounts for 6.1 and intermittency overall for 46. With solar installation costs of 1.52/W and CO2 social costs of 39/ton, 20{\%} solar would be welfare neutral.},

abstract = {REST2, a high-performance model to predict cloudless-sky broadband irradiance, illuminance and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from atmospheric data, is presented. Its derivation uses the same two-band scheme as in the previous CPCR2 model, but with numerous improvements. Great attention is devoted to precisely account for the effect of aerosols, in particular. Detailed research-class measurements from Billings, OK are used to assess the performance of the model for the prediction of direct, diffuse and global broadband irradiance. These measurements were made in May 2003 during a sophisticated radiative closure experiment, which involved the best radiometric instrumentation currently available and many ancillary instruments. As a whole, these exceptional measurements constitute the only known modern benchmark dataset made specifically to test the intrinsic performance of radiation models. Using this dataset as reference, it is shown that REST2 performs better than CPCR2 for irradiance, illuminance or PAR predictions. The availability of the turbidity data required by REST2 or other similar models is also discussed, as well as the effect that turbidity has on each component of broadband irradiance, PAR irradiance and illuminance, and on the diffuse/global PAR ratio.},

As the solar surface irradiance can be inferred from satellite measurements with a high temporal and spatial resolution, we use satellite images as a data source for forecasting. The satellite data provide information on cloudiness, the most important atmospheric parameter for surface irradiance. This paper describes the application of a statistical method to detect the motion of cloud structures from satellite images. Extrapolating the temporal development of the cloud situation, solar radiation can be predicted for time scales from 30 min up to 2 h. The forecasts are evaluated with respect to accuracy and an example for the application of the forecast algorithm to predict PV power output is presented.},

A number of analysis and data presentation techniques are presented to assess different aspects of this variability over the course of the day, and across different seasons.

@article{Hill2012,
abstract = {As solar photovoltaic power generation becomes more commonplace, the inherent intermittency of the solar resource poses one of the great challenges to those who would design and implement the next generation smart grid. Specifically, grid-tied solar power generation is a distributed resource whose output can change extremely rapidly, resulting in many issues for the distribution system operator with a large quantity of installed photovoltaic devices. Battery energy storage systems are increasingly being used to help integrate solar power into the grid. These systems are capable of absorbing and delivering both real and reactive power with sub-second response times. With these capabilities, battery energy storage systems can mitigate such issues with solar power generation as ramp rate, frequency, and voltage issues. Beyond these applications focusing on system stability, energy storage control systems can also be integrated with energy markets to make the solar resource more economical. Providing a high-level introduction to this application area, this paper presents an overview of the challenges of integrating solar power to the electricity distribution system, a technical overview of battery energy storage systems, and illustrates a variety of modes of operation for battery energy storage systems in grid-tied solar applications. The real-time control modes discussed include ramp rate control, frequency droop response, power factor correction, solar time-shifting, and output leveling.},

abstract = {The higher penetration of renewable resources in the energy portfolios of several communities accentuates the need for accurate forecasting of variable resources (solar, wind, tidal) at several different temporal scales in order to achieve power grid balance. Solar generation technologies have experienced strong energy market growth in the past few years, with corresponding increase in local grid penetration rates. As is the case with wind, the solar resource at the ground level is highly variable mostly due to cloud cover variability, atmospheric aerosol levels, and indirectly and to a lesser extent, participating gases in the atmosphere. The inherent variability of solar generation at higher grid penetration levels poses problems associated with the cost of reserves, dispatchable and ancillary generation, and grid reliability in general. As a result, high accuracy forecast systems are required for multiple time horizons that are associated with regulation, dispatching, scheduling and unit commitment. Here we review the theory behind these forecasting methodologies, and a number of successful applications of solar forecasting methods for both the solar resource and the power output of solar plants at the utility scale level.},

Because ground-based measurements of solar radiation are usually scarce, several methods have been proposed to estimate the solar radiation incoming on a horizontal surface at ground level from satellite imagery. These satellite-based estimations can be used as such, or combined with ground-based measurements. Because the satellite data sets differ in spatial and temporal resolution, this study evaluates the sensitivity of the satellite-derived daily surface solar irradiation to the underlying space and time resolution. More precisely, three surface solar radiation data sets retrieved from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites are compared against ground-based measurements. Additionally, the benefit of merging information from the ground-based measurements with satellite data is explored.

abstract = {Irradiance forecasts are fundamental to the prediction of power production from photovoltaic (PV) plants. Prediction is necessary to perform eﬀective balancing of electricity demand and the variable and weather-dependent supply. Images from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites provide valuable information for forecasting clouds and solar irradiance several hours ahead using cloud-motion vectors (CMV). In this chapter we present our approach to deriving irradiance information from MSG images and to predicting the cloud situation by applying CMV. An evaluation of the irradiance forecast for single sites and regional averages on the basis of a 1 y dataset is presented. The CMV forecast shows superior performance in comparison to other methods such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) up to 5 h ahead. Additionally, an introduction to PV-power-prediction techniques is presented.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a post-processing technique in order to improve mesoscale WRF solar radiation outputs. More precisely, one day ahead (with a 1h temporal resolution) global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasts calculated by the WRF model are bias-corrected through the use of an ANN. ANNs are data driven approaches capable of recognizing patterns in data. Training data obtained from a ground station are used to construct the ANN model in order to reduce the bias of the WRF forecasts. A bias error analysis allows the determination of the relevant ANN's inputs necessary to this bias correction. Among others, one can cite the solar zenith angle and the clear sky index. This specific model output statistics (MOS) technique is applied in the frame of a solar PV forecasting project that takes place in La Reunion Island, a French oversea territory located in the Indian Ocean. This insular feature makes solar forecasting very challenging, hence the need for advanced solar forecasting methods},

abstract = {Abstract. A satellite retrieval of surface solar irradiance (SSI) based on GOES satellite data is presented and validated for the French Guiana with 4 years of in situ measurements from 6 ground stations. We propose a particle filter approach combining GOES satellite observations and in situ data. We propose an original observation function based on a joint probability distribution and taking advantage of the characteristics of both involved types of data. The statistical results are compared with those of existing estimation methods and they are found to be in accordance. The daily bias ranges from −12 W/m2 (−6{\%} of the mean of measurements) to 12 W/m2 (6{\%}), depending on the stations. The daily root mean square difference ranges between 23 W/m2 (10{\%}) and 27 W/m2 (15{\%}). The correlation coefficient is close to 0.92. There is no seasonal climatic effect on the method, the bias and RMSD remain similar for both the rainy and the dry seasons, but better correlation is observed in the rainy season than in the dr...},

A new physically-based endogenous method to forecast power output and ramps a few minutes ahead is presented. This cloud speed persistence method consists of advecting the current distribution of power output across the plant using endogenous measurements of cloud motion vectors. The method was validated at a 48MW photovoltaic power plant in south-western Nevada, USA. Excluding clear days and in terms of the percentage root mean squared error the new method outperformed persistence by 16.2{\%} at 20s, 10.6{\%} at 60s, and 4.0{\%} at 120s forecast horizon. Given plant dimensions (1807×539m) and cloud motion vectors at the site, the method can be applied out to forecast horizons of 65 s, on average.},

abstract = {We develop and validate a medium-term solar irradiance forecasting model by adopting predicted meteorological variables from the US National Weather Service's (NWS) forecasting database as inputs to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Since the inputs involved are the same as the ones available from a recently validated forecasting model, we include mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R2) comparisons between the more established forecasting model and the proposed ones. An important component of our study is the development of a set of criteria for selecting relevant inputs. The input variables are selected using a version of the Gamma test combined with a genetic algorithm. The solar geotemporal variables are found to be critically important, while the most relevant meteorological variables include sky cover, probability of precipitation, and maximum and minimum temperatures. Using the relevant input sets identified by the Gamma test, the developed forecasting models improve RMSEs for GHI by 10–15{\%} over the reference model. Prediction intervals based on regression of the squared residuals on the input variables are also derived.},

abstract = {Numerical weather prediction (NWP) is generally the most accurate tool for forecasting solar irradiation several hours in advance. This study validates the North American Model (NAM), Global Forecast System (GFS), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasts for the continental United States (CONUS) using SURFRAD ground measurement data. Persistence and clear sky forecasts are also evaluated. For measured clear conditions all NWP models are biased by less than 50Wm−2. For measured cloudy conditions these biases can exceed 200Wm−2 near solar noon. In general, the NWP models (especially GFS and NAM) are biased towards forecasting clear conditions resulting in large, positive biases. Mean bias errors (MBE) are obtained for each NWP model as a function of solar zenith angle and forecast clear sky index, kt∗, to derive a bias correction function through model output statistics (MOS). For forecast clear sky conditions, the NAM and GFS are found to be positively biased by up to 150Wm−2, while ECMWF MBE is small. The GFS and NAM forecasts were found to exceed clear sky irradiances by up to 40{\%}, indicating an inaccurate clear sky model. For forecast cloudy conditions (kt∗{\textless}0.4) the NAM and GFS models have a negative bias of up to −150Wm−2. ECMWF forecasts are most biased for moderate cloudy conditions (0.4{\textless}kt∗{\textless}0.9) with an average over-prediction of 100Wm−2. MOS-corrected NWP forecasts based on solar zenith angle and kt∗ provide an important baseline accuracy to evaluate other forecasting techniques. MOS minimizes MBE for all NWP models. Root mean square errors for hourly-averaged daytime irradiances are also reduced by 50Wm−2, especially for intermediate clear sky indices. The MOS-corrected GFS provides the best solar forecasts for the CONUS with an RMSE of about 85Wm−2, followed by ECMWF and NAM. ECMWF is the most accurate forecast in cloudy conditions, while GFS has the best clear sky accuracy.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming useful as alternate approaches to conventional techniques or as components of integrated systems. They have been used to solve complicated practical problems in various areas and are becoming more popular nowadays. They can learn from examples, are fault tolerant in the sense that they are able to handle noisy and incomplete data, are able to deal with nonlinear problems and once trained can perform prediction and generalization at high speed. AI-based systems are being developed and deployed worldwide in a wide variety of applications, mainly because of their symbolic reasoning, flexibility and explanation capabilities. AI has been used in different sectors, such as engineering, economics, medicine, military, marine, etc. They have also been applied for modeling, identification, optimization, prediction, forecasting and control of complex systems. The paper outlines an understanding of how AI systems operate by way of presenting a number of problems in photovoltaic systems application. Problems presented include three areas: forecasting and modeling of meteorological data, sizing of photovoltaic systems and modeling, simulation and control of photovoltaic systems. Published literature presented in this paper show the potential of AI as design tool in photovoltaic systems.},

abstract = {Forecasting of solar irradiance is in general significant for planning the operations of power plants which convert renewable energies into electricity. In particular, the possibility to predict the solar irradiance (up to 24 h or even more) can became - with reference to the Grid Connected Photovoltaic Plants (GCPV) - fundamental in making power dispatching plans and - with reference to stand alone and hybrid systems - also a useful reference for improving the control algorithms of charge controllers. In this paper, a practical method for solar irradiance forecast using artificial neural network (ANN) is presented. The proposed Multilayer Perceptron MLP-model makes it possible to forecast the solar irradiance on a base of 24 h using the present values of the mean daily solar irradiance and air temperature. An experimental database of solar irradiance and air temperature data (from July 1st 2008 to May 23rd 2009 and from November 23rd 2009 to January 24th 2010) has been used. The database has been collected in Trieste (latitude 45°40′N, longitude 13°46′E), Italy. In order to check the generalization capability of the MLP-forecaster, a K-fold cross-validation was carried out. The results indicate that the proposed model performs well, while the correlation coefficient is in the range 98-99{\%} for sunny days and 94-96{\%} for cloudy days. As an application, the comparison between the forecasted one and the energy produced by the GCPV plant installed on the rooftop of the municipality of Trieste shows the goodness of the proposed model. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Mieslinger2014,
abstract = {When planning solar plants project developers and financers consider the long-term average of solar radiation and its uncertainty as the most important site selection criteria. Accurate time series of at least 10 years length are needed to calculate realistic estimates of such long-term averages. Ground-based measurements usually are not available for long time periods, but satellite- derived data may show significant differences compared to more accurate ground-measured values with respect to instantaneous values and frequency distribution. To overcome these shortcomings a new method for adaption of satellite-derived solar radiation values to ground measured time-series is developed. One year of overlapping time period is used for training the adaption. A weighted polynomial fit with additional constraints is then applied to the remaining satellite-derived solar radiation values. The method is tested at two sites for four satellite data models. The results show improvements for all data sets. After applying the adaption also during periods where no ground-based measurements are available the bias on average is nearing 0{\%} for most models. This requires that the satellite-derived data realistically represent the interannual variability. Frequency distributions are also matching better. Especially this is the case for maxima, which can be critical for design purposes.},

The various forms of kriging are among the best known in the earth sciences although techniques such as inverse distance weighting were and are in use for spatially located data. In the numerical analysis literature various forms of splines and more recently radial basis functions have been developed and used. Because these techniques have been developed in very different contexts the relationship between them has not always been apparent. Various forms of kriging are considered as well as kernel estimators, splines and radial basis functions. By using the dual form of kriging and the positive definiteness property of the variogram connections are shown between splines, kriging and radial basis functions. One of the distinctions between kriging and other interpolators is the incorporation of the support of the samples and explicit estimation of linear functionals such as spatial integrals.},

We investigate spatio-temporal models with separable and nonseparable covariance structures and find no evidence to support assuming a separable covariance structure. Our results indicate a promising approach for modeling irradiance at high spatial resolution consistent with available ground-based measurements.

abstract = {We evaluate and compare several forecasting techniques using no exogenous inputs for predicting the solar power output of a 1MWp, single-axis tracking, photovoltaic power plant operating in Merced, California. The production data used in this work corresponds to hourly averaged power collected from November 2009 to August 2011. Data prior to January 2011 is used to train the several forecasting models for the 1 and 2h-ahead hourly averaged power output. The methods studied in this work are: Persistent model, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNNs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and ANNs optimized by Genetic Algorithms (GAs/ANN). The accuracy of the models is determined by computing error statistics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), and the coefficient of correlation (R2) for the differences between the forecasted values and the measured values for the period from January to August of 2011. This work also addresses the accuracy of the different methods as a function of the variability of the power output, which depends strongly on seasonal conditions. The findings show that the ANN-based forecasting models perform better than the other forecasting techniques, that substantial improvements can be achieved with a GA optimization of the ANN parameters, and that the accuracy of all models depends strongly on seasonal characteristics of solar variability.},

abstract = {This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of satellite-based methods for deriving solar irradiance components for analyzing the impact of the external inputs that are normally associated to the satellite model. Different sensitivity calculations have been performed using as reference site the PSA (Solar Platform of Almeria) station placed at the south-east of Spain. Thus, the sensitivity to the aerosol information input has been addressed by comparing the estimations using aerosol input from AERONET data with those using aerosol dataset such as MODIS or MISR (based on satellite) and MACC (based on reanalysis). Sensitivity to the clear sky model choice has been also studied by using three different models, from the simpler ESRA model (in terms of input parameters) to the most sophisticated REST2. Finally, three global to direct conversion models (Louche, DirInt and DirIndex) have been included to explore the sensitivity of the direct normal irradiance estimations. The sensitivity analysis has shown the interrelations between the different cases according to the uncertainty of the input information used. The results have been analyzed for clear and non-clear sky conditions separately and for the DNI irradiance range of 400–900 W m−2 as a case of special interest for the concentrating solar power applications. The work presented here has as novelty the analysis of the propagation of uncertainty of individual models and atmospheric datasets in the framework of a satellite-based model for solar irradiance computation and their relative weights to the final performance of the model. An underestimation of AOD by 50{\%} causes an error in the global horizontal irradiance calculated by a clear sky model of 3–5{\%} depending on the model used, and slightly less for an overestimation of AOD. For DNI the error ranges are 12–15{\%} and 9–12{\%} for 50{\%} underestimation and overestimation of AOD respectively.},

Northwest India is expected to have a high level of solar radiation and it is an interesting area for solar concentrating power systems. However uncertainty in direct normal irradiance estimations from satellite may affect negatively to the bankability of solar plants. Direct normal irradiance have been estimated for a site in Rajasthan from satellite information for the period 2003 to 2011, and ground measurements during 2011 have been used to analyze the uncertainties and to develop a simple correction method. The original satellite estimations showed important deviations from the experimental values and high bias. A systematic underestimation of direct irradiance has been observed during the dryer seasons that could be attributed to an overestimation of the aerosol optical depth input to the model. These observations have allowed the design of a correction methodology. Unbiased new estimations of direct normal irradiance have been generated with this methodology with important reduction in the deviations and with an agreement in the distribution functions compared to the distribution function of the ground data.},

abstract = {Proper quantification of the available solar resource is essential for the diverse development phases of any solar power plant. At local scale, the solar resource is best assessed from ground radiometric stations. At regional-to-continental scales, however, satellite-based techniques are currently the most suitable approach. Solar radiation evaluation using numerical weather prediction (NWP) models presents some advantages over satellite-based techniques. Nonetheless, gridded solar radiation estimates using either satellite-based or NWP-based techniques still produce biased estimates which are often much higher for the latter. Therefore, a correction needs to be applied before these gridded values are usable for solar applications, especially for NWP-based estimates. This contribution introduces an original method based on the optimal interpolation technique to adjust gridded solar radiation estimates consistently with concomitant radiometric ground observations. The method's performance is demonstrated using NWP-based gridded estimates with 10-km spacing of global and direct monthly irradiation data during the 10-year period from 2003 to 2012 over continental Spain and the Balearic Islands. It is shown that the proposed methodology produces adjusted gridded values that are (or nearly always are, in the case of direct irradiation) within the expected measurement uncertainty of the ground observations, provided a sufficiently large number of observations is available for correction. For the studied region and these NWP-based gridded datasets, our findings suggest that a homogeneous mean distance between ground observations of 100–150km can result in unbiased gridded estimates.},

abstract = {Renewable generation is growing at a rapid rate due to the incentives available and the aggressive renewable portfolio standard targets implemented by state governments. Distributed generation in particular is seeing the fastest growth among renewable energy projects, and is directly related to the incentives. Hawaii has the highest electricity costs in the country due to the high percentage of oil burning steam generation, and therefore has some of the highest penetration of distributed PV in the nation. The High Penetration PV project on Oahu aims to understand the effects of high penetration PV on the distribution level, to identify penetration levels creating disturbances on the circuit, and to offer mitigating solutions based on model results. Power flow models are validated using data collected from solar resources and load monitors deployed throughout the circuit. Existing interconnection methods and standards are evaluated in these emerging high penetration scenarios. A key finding is a shift in the level of detail to be considered and moving away from steady-state peak time analysis towards dynamic and time varying simulations. Each level of normal interconnection study is evaluated and enhanced to a new level of detail, allowing full understanding of each issue.},

It begins with selected applications of short-term forecasting to both transmission- and distribution-scale generation. The hardware used in sky-imaging systems is next presented, providing technical and historical information on system optics and sensory equipment (e.g., charge-coupled devices). A high-quality sky-imaging system designed by the authors (the USI) is then briefly examined. The core of the chapter consists of describing sky-imagery analysis techniques, followed by their application to a large solar-power plant. The techniques used to detect clouds, determine their height, and estimate their motion are explained. Application of these methods to generate a power forecast is presented in a case study of a 48 MW solar-power plant, for which a week of data was analyzed. The results are discussed and ideas for improvement are presented. Finally, recommendations for advancing ground-based visible-wavelength imagery and forecast performance are presented.},

We particularly look at the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). After optimizing our architecture with NWP and endogenous data previously made stationary and using an innovative pre-input layer selection method, we combined it to an ARMA model from a rule based on the analysis of hourly data series. This model has been used to forecast the hourly global radiation for five places in Mediterranean area. Our technique outperforms classical models for all the places. The nRMSE for our hybrid model MLP/ARMA is 14.9{\%} compared to 26.2{\%} for the na{\"{i}}ve persistence predictor. Note that in the standalone ANN case the nRMSE is 18.4{\%}. Finally, in order to discuss the reliability of the forecaster outputs, a complementary study concerning the confidence interval of each prediction is proposed.},

@article{Wang2012,
abstract = {Short-term solar irradiance forecasting (STSIF) is of great significance for the optimal operation and power predication of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) plants. However, STSIF is very complex to handle due to the random and nonlinear characteristics of solar irradiance under changeable weather conditions. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is suitable for STSIF modeling and many research works on this topic are presented, but the conciseness and robustness of the existing models still need to be improved. After discussing the relation between weather variations and irradiance, the characteristics of the statistical feature parameters of irradiance under different weather conditions are figured out. A novel ANN model using statistical feature parameters (ANN-SFP) for STSIF is proposed in this paper. The input vector is reconstructed with several statistical feature parameters of irradiance and ambient temperature. Thus sufficient information can be effectively extracted from relatively few inputs and the model complexity is reduced. The model structure is determined by cross-validation (CV), and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is used for the network training. Simulations are carried out to validate and compare the proposed model with the conventional ANN model using historical data series (ANN-HDS), and the results indicated that the forecast accuracy is obviously improved under variable weather conditions.},

abstract = {Forecasting solar energy generation is a challenging task because of the variety of solar power systems and weather regimes encountered. Inaccurate forecasts can result in substantial economic losses and power system reliability issues. One of the key challenges is the unavailability of a consistent and robust set of metrics to measure the accuracy of a solar forecast. This paper presents a suite of generally applicable and value-based metrics for solar forecasting for a comprehensive set of scenarios (i.e., different time horizons, geographic locations, and applications) that were developed as part of the U.S. Department of Energy SunShot Initiative's efforts to improve the accuracy of solar forecasting. In addition, a comprehensive framework is developed to analyze the sensitivity of the proposed metrics to three types of solar forecasting improvements using a design-of-experiments methodology in conjunction with response surface, sensitivity analysis, and nonparametric statistical testing methods. The three types of forecasting improvements are (i) uniform forecasting improvements when there is not a ramp, (ii) ramp forecasting magnitude improvements, and (iii) ramp forecasting threshold changes. Day-ahead and 1-hour-ahead forecasts for both simulated and actual solar power plants are analyzed. The results show that the proposed metrics can efficiently evaluate the quality of solar forecasts and assess the economic and reliability impacts of improved solar forecasting. Sensitivity analysis results show that (i) all proposed metrics are suitable to show the changes in the accuracy of solar forecasts with uniform forecasting improvements, and (ii) the metrics of skewness, kurtosis, and R{\'{e}}nyi entropy are specifically suitable to show the changes in the accuracy of solar forecasts with ramp forecasting improvements and a ramp forecasting threshold.},

abstract = {We use a Bayesian method, optimal interpolation, to improve satellite derived irradiance estimates at city-scales using ground sensor data. Optimal interpolation requires error covariances in the satellite estimates and ground data, which define how information from the sensor locations is distributed across a large area. We describe three methods to choose such covariances, including a covariance parameterization that depends on the relative cloudiness between locations. Results are computed with ground data from 22 sensors over a 75×80km area centered on Tucson, AZ, using two satellite derived irradiance models. The improvements in standard error metrics for both satellite models indicate that our approach is applicable to additional satellite derived irradiance models. We also show that optimal interpolation can nearly eliminate mean bias error and improve the root mean squared error by 50{\%}.},
