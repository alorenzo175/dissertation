abstract = {At any site, the bankability of a projected solar power plant largely depends on the accuracy and general quality of the solar radiation data generated during the solar resource assessment phase. The term “site adaptation” has recently started to be used in the framework of solar energy projects to refer to the improvement that can be achieved in satellite-derived solar irradiance and model data when short-term local ground measurements are used to correct systematic errors and bias in the original dataset. This contribution presents a preliminary survey of different possible techniques that can improve long-term satellite-derived and model-derived solar radiation data through the use of short-term on-site ground measurements. The possible approaches that are reported here may be applied in different ways, depending on the origin and characteristics of the uncertainties in the modeled data. This work, which is the first step of a forthcoming in-depth assessment of methodologies for site adaptation, has been done within the framework of the International Energy Agency Solar Heating and Cooling Programme Task 46 “Solar Resource Assessment and Forecasting”.},

abstract = {Forecasting solar energy generation is a challenging task because of the variety of solar power systems and weather regimes encountered. Inaccurate forecasts can result in substantial economic losses and power system reliability issues. One of the key challenges is the unavailability of a consistent and robust set of metrics to measure the accuracy of a solar forecast. This paper presents a suite of generally applicable and value-based metrics for solar forecasting for a comprehensive set of scenarios (i.e., different time horizons, geographic locations, and applications) that were developed as part of the U.S. Department of Energy SunShot Initiative's efforts to improve the accuracy of solar forecasting. In addition, a comprehensive framework is developed to analyze the sensitivity of the proposed metrics to three types of solar forecasting improvements using a design-of-experiments methodology in conjunction with response surface, sensitivity analysis, and nonparametric statistical testing methods. The three types of forecasting improvements are (i) uniform forecasting improvements when there is not a ramp, (ii) ramp forecasting magnitude improvements, and (iii) ramp forecasting threshold changes. Day-ahead and 1-hour-ahead forecasts for both simulated and actual solar power plants are analyzed. The results show that the proposed metrics can efficiently evaluate the quality of solar forecasts and assess the economic and reliability impacts of improved solar forecasting. Sensitivity analysis results show that (i) all proposed metrics are suitable to show the changes in the accuracy of solar forecasts with uniform forecasting improvements, and (ii) the metrics of skewness, kurtosis, and R{\'{e}}nyi entropy are specifically suitable to show the changes in the accuracy of solar forecasts with ramp forecasting improvements and a ramp forecasting threshold.},

abstract = {Proper quantification of the available solar resource is essential for the diverse development phases of any solar power plant. At local scale, the solar resource is best assessed from ground radiometric stations. At regional-to-continental scales, however, satellite-based techniques are currently the most suitable approach. Solar radiation evaluation using numerical weather prediction (NWP) models presents some advantages over satellite-based techniques. Nonetheless, gridded solar radiation estimates using either satellite-based or NWP-based techniques still produce biased estimates which are often much higher for the latter. Therefore, a correction needs to be applied before these gridded values are usable for solar applications, especially for NWP-based estimates. This contribution introduces an original method based on the optimal interpolation technique to adjust gridded solar radiation estimates consistently with concomitant radiometric ground observations. The method's performance is demonstrated using NWP-based gridded estimates with 10-km spacing of global and direct monthly irradiation data during the 10-year period from 2003 to 2012 over continental Spain and the Balearic Islands. It is shown that the proposed methodology produces adjusted gridded values that are (or nearly always are, in the case of direct irradiation) within the expected measurement uncertainty of the ground observations, provided a sufficiently large number of observations is available for correction. For the studied region and these NWP-based gridded datasets, our findings suggest that a homogeneous mean distance between ground observations of 100–150km can result in unbiased gridded estimates.},

abstract = {Abstract. A satellite retrieval of surface solar irradiance (SSI) based on GOES satellite data is presented and validated for the French Guiana with 4 years of in situ measurements from 6 ground stations. We propose a particle filter approach combining GOES satellite observations and in situ data. We propose an original observation function based on a joint probability distribution and taking advantage of the characteristics of both involved types of data. The statistical results are compared with those of existing estimation methods and they are found to be in accordance. The daily bias ranges from −12 W/m2 (−6{\%} of the mean of measurements) to 12 W/m2 (6{\%}), depending on the stations. The daily root mean square difference ranges between 23 W/m2 (10{\%}) and 27 W/m2 (15{\%}). The correlation coefficient is close to 0.92. There is no seasonal climatic effect on the method, the bias and RMSD remain similar for both the rainy and the dry seasons, but better correlation is observed in the rainy season than in the dr...},

@article{Bilionis2014,
abstract = {We construct a data-driven model for solar irradiation based on satellite observations. The model yields probabilistic estimates of the irradiation field every thirty minutes starting from two consecutive satellite measurements. The probabilistic nature of the model captures prediction uncertainties and can therefore be used by solar energy producers to quantify the operation risks. The model is simple to implement and can make predictions in realtime with minimal computational resources. To deal with the high-dimensionality of the satellite data, we construct a reduced representation using factor analysis. Then, we model the dynamics of the reduced representation as a discrete (30-min interval) dynamical system. In order to convey information about the movement of the irradiation field, the dynamical system has a two-step delay. The dynamics are represented in a nonlinear, nonparametric way by a recursive Gaussian process. The predictions of the model are compared with observed satellite data as well as with a similar model that uses only ground observations at the prediction site. We conclude that using satellite data in an area including the prediction site significantly improves the prediction compared with models using only ground observation site data.},

@article{Lauret2013,
abstract = {This paper proposes to use a rather new statistical approach in the realm of solar radiation modelling namely Bayesian inference. In this work, the theory of Bayesian inference will be presented at length. The Bayesian analysis consists in two levels. The first one is related to the parameter estimation while the second one concerns the model selection problem. As an illustration, a Bayesian parameter estimation method is used to derive a logistic hourly solar diffuse fraction model. A major difference between Bayesian and frequentist (or classical) methods is that the Bayesian inference offers a framework (through the use of prior information) to continuously update our posterior beliefs. In other words, all previous work is not wasted as the preceding model's parameters can be used as prior information for the derivation of the parameters estimates of the next (new) model. For this particular application, it is also shown that the use of Bayesian methods instead of classical statistical techniques lead to a less biased model.},

However, the availability of observed solar radiation measurements has proven to be spatially and temporally inadequate for many applications. In this paper we propose to merge the global solar radiation measurements from the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium solar measurements network with the operationally derived surface incoming global short-wave radiation products from Meteosat Second Generation satellites imageries to improve the spatio-temporal resolution of the surface global solar radiation data over Belgium. We evaluate several merging methods with various degrees of complexity (from mean field bias correction to geostatistical merging techniques) together with interpolated ground measurements and satellite-derived values only. The performance of the different methods is assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation.},
