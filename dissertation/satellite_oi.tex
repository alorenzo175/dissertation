\chapter{OPTIMAL INTERPOLATION TO IMPROVE SATELLITE NOWCASTS WITH DATA}
\label{chap:satoi}

Optimal interpolation (OI) is a Bayesian technique that combines data
from multiple sources based on their relative errors.
We use OI to combine the irradiance estimates derived from satellite
images (referred to as the background) and data from the sensor
network described in \cref{chap:sens_net} with the goal of producing
better satellite irradiance nowcasts (known as the analysis).
These analyses will be used as the basis for forecasts in future work.
This technique is described in \cref{app:pvsc43} and \cref{app:satoi}.
We show that by using this technique we can nearly eliminate the bias
present in these satellite derived irradiance estimates and reduce the
root mean squared error by over 50\% for one satellite to irradiance
model.

This chapter supplements the descriptions of OI presented in
\cref{app:pvsc43} and \cref{app:satoi}.
We describe the satellite image to ground irradiance algorithms we
used for OI in more depth, show how the parameters for OI were chosen,
and describe future work.

\section{Satellite to Irradiance Algorithms for OI}
In this section we will describe the satellite image to ground
irradiance algorithms used in \cref{app:satoi} and discuss other
algorithms.
One factor that affects how well OI performs for a given background
image generated from some satellite to irradiance algorithm is the
spatial resolution.
OI, as presented in \cref{app:satoi}, focuses on a relatively small,
city scale area.
This means that the background image must have sufficient density in
this area to extract the maximum amount of information from the
deployed sensors when correcting the image.
Furthermore, since our goal is to produce nowcasts, the algorithm
should only rely on data present at the current time and take a
reasonable amount of time to compute.

\subsection{UASIBS Model}

The University of Arizona Solar Irradiance Based on Satellite (UASIBS)
model was developed at the University of Arizona by Chang Ki Kim in
2015 \citep{Kim2016}.
This model relies on the infrared images of the GOES-W satellite to
find completely overcast areas based on a comparison of the brightness
temperature difference (difference between 10.7 and 3.9 $\mu$m
images) to a reference calculated over the past few weeks.
If the infrared channels do not find an area to be overcast, the
visible image is compared to a threshold image to determine if any of
the 16 pixels in the 4km $\times$ 4km box have a cloud.
Once pixels are classified as cloudy or clear, a look-up table is
employed to find the atmospheric transmittance and GHI on the ground
for each pixel.
A number of look-up tables are generated using the Goddard Space
Flight Center Radiative Transfer Model: one for clear sky
accounting for aerosols, one for high level clouds, one for mid level
clouds, one for low clouds, and one for cumulus clouds.

The look-up table approach to calculate transmittance is limited.
First, a number of climatological averages, specific to Tucson, are
used in the calculations of the look-up tables including AOD and
ozone.
Near real-time analysis and forecasts of AOD and ozone may improve
estimates.
The Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project
\citep{Morcrette2009} has such analysis and forecasts of AOD and ozone
available, and a ground truth measurement of AOD is available from the
Tucson AERONET site \citep{Holben1998}.
Another limitation of the look-up table approach is that only ten
values of the solar zenith angle are used which introduces artificial
steps noticeable in the output GHI.

UASIBS]{A scatterplot of the predicted vs measured clear-sky index for
UASIBS before OI (blue) and after (orange). The UASIBS algorithm does
not produce clear-sky indices between 0.6 and 0.8. OI helps correct
this somewhat. (Reproduced from \cite{Lorenzo2017})}
\label{fig:uasibs_scatter}
\end{figure}

The cloud detection methodology may also classify a cloud as the wrong
type leading to the use of the wrong look-up table.
This is illustrated in Fig.\@ 4 of \cref{app:satoi} reproduced in
\cref{fig:uasibs_scatter}.
There is a distinct lack of images with clear-sky index between 0.6
and 0.8 for UASIBS that requires further investigation to determine if
it is a problem with the look-up tables themselves or using the wrong
look-up table.
With newer, fast radiative transfer codes, perhaps the look-up table
approach can be replaced with a direct call to a radiative transfer
code to avoid many of these limitations.

\subsection{Semi-Empirical Model}
The semi-empirical model used and described in \cref{app:satoi} is
based on what is commonly know as the SUNY model developed by Perez
\etal \citep{Perez2002}.
This model was chosen because it is well known within the community
and provides a good benchmark.
The SUNY model was developed using ground truth sensors spread
throughout the US with few in arid climates and no sensor in Arizona.
Notably, Perez \etal recognized the deficiency in arid areas with high
ground albedos and proposed a method to correct this issue
\citep{Perez2004}.
The high ground albedo in Tucson combined with the empirical
coefficients developed for the entire US likely lead to the
overprediction of cloudy skies in \cref{fig:suny_scatter}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/suny_scatter.pdf}
\caption[Scatterplot of predicted vs measured clear-sky index for the
semi-empirical model]{A scatterplot of the predicted vs measured
  clear-sky index for semi-empirical model before OI (blue) and after
  (orange). The semi-empirical model tends to overpredict clouds as
  shown in the clear-sky index scatterplot on the left. The splitting
  for the background GHI in the right image is likely due to a time of day
  effect.  OI removes this splitting (Reproduced from
  \cite{Lorenzo2017})}
\label{fig:suny_scatter}
\end{figure}

A new, more strict test of OI in southern Arizona would be to
recalculate the empirical coefficients used in the semi-empirical
model for the area.
This would likely improve the background errors of the semi-empirical
model and may also improve the final errors after performing OI.

\subsection{Other Models}
There are numerous algorithms to convert satellite measured radiances
to ground irradiance.
A good overview of semi-empirical and physical methods can be found in
\cite{Perez2013a,Miller2013}.

One publicly available dataset is the GOES Surface and Insolation
Products (GSIP) \citep{Sengupta2010}.
GSIP provides hourly irradiance estimates at a resolution of 1/8
degree.
OI is unlikely to perform well with this low spatial resolution
({\raise.4ex \hbox{\texttildelow}}14km) where clouds are not well
resolved and many sensors are contained in a single grid cell.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is developing a new
algorithm called the Physical Solar Model (PSM) that has been used to update
the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) \citep{Sengupta2014}.
NSRDB provides 30 minute 4km $\times$ 4km data covering the US (and
some other countries) from 1998 to 2015.
One could explore how OI performs for an NSRDB background, but the low
spatial resolution may prove limiting.
Furthermore, the PSM algorithm is still in development.

\section{Correlation Parameterization}
\label{sec:corr_param}

Section 4 of \cref{app:satoi} describes various correlation
parameterizations we studied.
The semi-empirical model is essentially a polynomial relationship
between the cloudiness as measured by the satellite and the clearness
observed on the ground.
Therefore, one might expect that OI with the cloudiness correlation
parameterization essentially modifies this cloudiness to clearness
function.
This is in fact the case as demonstrated in
\cref{fig:cldclr_se_419,fig:cldclr_se_615}.
These figures show the analysis produced by OI for the three
correlation methods along with a plot of the adjusted visible albedo
from the satellite (cloudiness) versus the clear-sky index estimate of the
background and analysis (clearness).
Notice that cloudiness correlation tends to change the form of this
cloudiness to clearness function for the analysis, whereas the spatial
and empirical correlation parameterizations tend to broaden the curve
instead.

\label{fig:cldclr_se_419}
\end{figure}

  reshape the analysis curve whereas the other parameterizations broaden it.}
\label{fig:cldclr_se_615}
\end{figure}

An example of the same cloudiness to clearness graphs but for the
UASIBS model is shown in \cref{fig:cldclr_ua_615}.
The UASIBS algorithm is more complex and not a simple function
of the adjusted visible albedo, but each correlation parameterization
changes this cloudiness to clearness mapping in a different way.
Also note the undesirable ``bulls-eye'' like pattern in the spatial
correlation analysis image\footnote{This may not be visible in the
  printed form of this dissertation.} that does not correspond with
reality.

  clear-sky index is not a relatively simple function of the adjusted
  visible albedo. However, the correlation parameterizations still
  adjust the cloudiness to clearness mapping in different ways.}
\label{fig:cldclr_ua_615}
\end{figure}


\section{Parameter Estimation}
\label{sec:paramopt}

Section 6 of \cref{app:satoi} discusses the tuning of OI for a
specific location including the estimation of the parameters $k,\:
l,\: d$ by minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) of the analysis
over sensors withheld from OI.
A minimization via a grid search over the parameters was performed and
the resulting MSE for each set of parameters is shown in
\cref{fig:paramopt}.

\begin{figure}[p]
\centering
\captionsetup[subfigure]{labelformat=empty}
\subfloat{\hspace{-1em} \includegraphics[width=1.05\textwidth]{figs/uasibs_optsurf.pdf}}

\caption[Optimization surfaces for OI parameters]{Optimization
surfaces for the parameters $k,\: l,\: d$ of the optimal interpolation
routine. The columns represent different choices of $k$, the rows
distinguish between cloudiness and spatial correlation, the y-axis is
$l$ and the x-axis is $d^{1/2}$. The top figure shows surfaces for the
UASIBS model and the bottom is for the semi-empirical model. Note,
that for all choices of $k$ and the correlation parameterization, the
surfaces for the UASIBS model have a clear minimum. The surfaces for
the semi-empirical model have less distinct minima (even after
rescaling for the spatial correlation set) indicating that optimal
interpolation is not as sensitive to parameter choice for this model.}
\label{fig:paramopt}
\end{figure}

This figure clearly shows distinct minima in parameter space for the
UASIBS satellite to irradiance model which indicates that  OI is
sensitive to the choice of parameters.
On the other hand, the lack of distinct minima in parameter space for
the semi-empirical model indicates that a wide range of parameters would
give similar results after performing OI.
If in the future the semi-empirical model is chosen as the background model
for an OI based routine, a more thorough investigation into why OI is
insensitive to these parameters is warranted.


\section{Image Position Errors}
Section 5 of \cref{app:satoi} describes how errors in the satellite
image position relative to the ground sensors are corrected by
minimizing the MSE of the OI analysis.
These location errors primarily effect OI with the cloudiness
correlation parameterization.
This correction is not perfect and does not always work as intended.
An example of a failure of this method for the semi-empirical model is
shown in \cref{fig:parallax_err}.


\begin{figure}[p]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figs/cld_to_clear_Semi-Empirical_2014-06-11.png}
\caption[An example of a failure of the geolocation correction]{
  An example on 2014-06-11 at 15:00 where the geolocation correction
  for the cloudiness correlation parameterization and the
  semi-empirical model fails. The large, positive slope in the
  cloudiness to clearness graph is indicative of this failure since it
  does not make physical sense.}
\label{fig:parallax_err}
\end{figure}

The cloudiness to clearness plots discussed in \cref{sec:corr_param}
may provide a method to detect when these location errors occur.
The large positive slope in the cloudiness to clearness plot of
\cref{fig:parallax_err} essentially indicates that a higher
reflectivity as seen by the satellite indicates fewer clouds.
This is highly unlikely and is an indication that the MSE location
correction was insufficient.
A better method to correct for position errors may take into account
both the slope of the adjusted visible albedo to clear-sky index
mapping and the MSE of the OI analysis.

\section{Future Work}
Much can be done to extend the work in \cref{app:satoi}.
The first likely extension is to use these nowcasts of irradiance to
produce a forecast as in \cref{app:network} where the OI analysis
replaces the interpolated map and is advected by a cloud wind.
This can then be extended further with a better advection scheme and
a more complex wind field.

One also could explore the valid range of OI, e.g.~can information
from sensors in Tucson be used to correct the background image over
Phoenix 100 miles away?
Perhaps other parameterizations, such as a combination of cloudiness
and spatial correlation, will be necessary for OI to perform well in
this situation.

Another topic one could explore is distinguishing between cloud layers
when performing OI.
Say for example that sensor 1 is covered by a low cloud while sensor 2
is covered by a high cloud.
It might be helpful to separate these layers so that sensor 1 provides
information to correct the low clouds while sensor 2 provides
information about the high clouds.
In addition to possibly improving the OI result, knowledge of the
cloud layers will also help with forecasting since each layer can be
advected independently.

A natural extension of OI with a forecast is the Kalman filter.
The Kalman filter would essentially perform OI, move the image
according to a cloud advection scheme, and repeat with new
observations using the shifted image as the background.
Since the satellite takes a new image at least every 30 minutes, there
are two sources of data that the update step should incorporate: the
sensor data available every 5 minutes and the new satellite image
every 30 minutes.
A forecasting system using such a Kalman filter is described in
\cref{chap:satfx}.
